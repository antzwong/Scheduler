# Scheduler

## description 
Program is designed to be an automatic schedule maker based off of tasks which are input from a text file. The driving idea behind this program is that the eisenhower matrix is often how we prioratize tasks (due date and importance). Thus, it is possible to have a program create a daily schedule for us based off of the eisenhower matrix, while accounting for tasks which are fixed throughout the day e.g. meetings, professional commitments, etc. 

## logic
Main datastructure of this program is a priority queue

## tasks
Currently working on file input. Description for how tasks are input with appropriate due dates and importance are described in the comments of the java file.
