# Scheduler

## description 
Program is designed to be an automatic schedule maker based off of tasks which are input from a text file. The driving idea behind this program is that the eisenhower matrix (due date vs importance) is often how we prioratize personal tasks e.g. homework, club commitments, etc. Thus, it is possible to have a program create a daily schedule for us based off of the eisenhower matrix instead of us having to spend mental energy creating a schedule ourselves. This program must also account for tasks which are fixed throughout the day e.g. meetings, professional commitments, etc. 

## logic
Main datastructure of this program is a priority queue

## tasks
Currently working on file input. Description for how tasks are input with appropriate due dates and importance are described in the comments of the java file.
